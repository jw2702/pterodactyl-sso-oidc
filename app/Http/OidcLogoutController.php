/**
 * Reached after Pterodactyl's own logout button (client dashboard or admin
 * panel - see data/install.sh, both are patched) has already POSTed to
 * /auth/logout, redirecting here instead of straight to Pterodactyl.
 *
 * Only actually does anything for sessions that were established via SSO
 * (identified by the id_token_hint cookie reference - see
 * consumeIdTokenHint()); anyone who logged in with a plain username/password
 * just lands back on the panel like normal, since RP-Initiated Logout has
 * nothing to do with them. For an actual SSO session, without this the
 * IdP's own browser session (e.g. authentik) would stay alive, so hitting
 * the login page again - especially with hide_password_login enabled -
 * would silently sign the user straight back in. This performs OIDC
 * RP-Initiated Logout (using the discovery document's end_session_endpoint,
 * if the provider exposes one) so both sessions end together.
